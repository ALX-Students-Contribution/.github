# 🎓 Welcome to the ALX Student's Contribution page! 🚀
ALX Student's Contribution is a community of ALX students who are passionate about contributing to open source projects and doing hard things. We are willing to make contributions back to the ALX community or work on other open source projects.

### 🐛 Bug Reports and Feature Requests
We welcome contributions to fix bugs and add new features to our ALX Student's Contribution repository. If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue on the repository so that we can track it.

If you can fix the bug or implement the feature, please follow the normal flow and submit a pull request with the changes. In the pull request description, reference the issue you're fixing by using "Fixes #1234" format, where 1234 is the issue number. This ensures that the issue is automatically closed when the pull request is merged.

If you are unable to fix the bug or implement the feature, don't worry, we will attend to it as soon as we can. Every contribution, big or small, is appreciated and we value the time and effort put into making our community better.
